# DatabaseDesign

Year 2 University Databases assignment. We were tasked to design a database for a fictional university and provide a diagram, 
a Microsoft Access front-end and MySQL code for it.

The database was hosted on the University server for the duration of the assignment, but can be created on any MySQL server
using the code provided in the "appdatabase.sql" file.

The Access front-end file was meant to connect to said university server through the university intranet via lab computers,
so it's functionality outside of that environment is not guaranteed.
